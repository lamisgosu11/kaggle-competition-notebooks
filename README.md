## My notebooks for Kaggle competitions

> #### **Notes**
>
> Some of these notebooks are edited copies of the original notebooks I used to submit to Kaggle, which have better result (\_editied.ipynb). The original notebooks are also included in the repository (\_og.ipynb) for reference.

For competition references, please visit [My Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/lmnggia/competitions)
I may give up on some competitions, so the list of notebooks may not be complete. Also, I may not have time to update the notebooks to the latest version. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I will try to help you as much as I can.
